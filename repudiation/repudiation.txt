- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
        In the insecure version, the server does not authenticates the user who is sending the
        message. Messages are not associated with users or logs so its hard to trace and prove
        who sent what.
        In the secure version, the user is required to authenticate before sending message. Every
        message is also logged so a traceable record of who performed what actions is kept to ensure
        that there is evidence of who performed a certain action.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
    Strong authentication and session management can be incorporated.
